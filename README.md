# ParallelGPUDataLoader
The ParallelGPUDataLoader repository provides an efficient solution for parallel data loading, specifically designed to leverage the power of multiple GPUs. This repository aims to accelerate data processing pipelines that involve large datasets by enabling simultaneous loading and preprocessing of data across multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). For the same, I utilised the bach dataset.
